# Calculator
A calculator I've been working on using my knowledge of GUI's that I learned in class.

# Updates:
- Added square, square root, clear button and delete button
- Added unimplemented methods add, subtract, divide, multiply, square and squareRoot in order to clean up the mess in the handle method

# TODO:
- Implement unimplemented methods
- Add brackets and BEDMAS functionality
- Make GUI more advanced

# Current GUI Look:
